              					You could say that it takes around 45 hours to make, finish and tune a keyless flute. That is, if you only count production “man hours” for making the flute sections and all the small parts that make up instrument, like tuning slide tubes, rings, adjustable stoppers, inlaid end-caps, etc. But if you also include the time for seasoning the wood billets, and the weeks for the blank to settle each time a section has been cut, turned, gun-drilled or reamed, and the days to allow the toughened epoxies to cure after parts are bonded, and time needed for the finishing oils to soak into the wood and harden after each treatment during the months of manufacture, then the total time would be closer to four years.</p><p>For a keyed flute add another few months... for block mount milling and drilling, key-making, fitting, padding and polishing!</p>

              					    Please take a good look at the pdf entitled <b><a href='assets/2013WindwardCare.pdf' target='_blank'>Windward Care</a></b>. When your flute is brand new, be sure to follow the “playing-in” schedule and instructions. This will add many years to the life of instrument and will prevent the risk of cracking the flute by over-playing it, before it has had a chance to slowly season with moisture and bore oil. Good maintenance habits also help you get to know your instrument, and your flute will give back tenfold when it is well cared for.

              					Every Windward flute is accessible to the beginner. The embouchure cut requires minimal air, and new players are often surprised at how easy our flutes are to sound. Yet the flute will give more of its complexity, nuance and colour as it is played-in, and as the player improves. We are frequently told that the Windward instrument itself gets better and better the more it is played, and we do not argue that this is entirely due the player’s developing ability. The flute improves with the player, and it seems the player does not outgrow the flute.

              					Flute teachers often recommend that a beginner start on a keyless Irish flute before learning to play a keyed flute, to explore cross-fingering and half-holing techniques. We do not retrofit keys onto a keyless flute, but often players order a keyed flute later, and continue to use use both in their repertoire.

              					The answer is somewhat subjective when discussing the part that wood type plays in tone quality, and tone  depends on other factors as well, like the embouchure, the bore, and the player.</p><p class='p2'><b>Grenadilla</b>, also known as African blackwood, has been the favourite flute wood for the trad player. It is dense and resinous, and a Grenadilla flute gives a good “bark” and has plenty of volume. One drawback is that the resins in this wood can cause contact dermatitis.</p><p class='p2'><b>Mopane</b> is equal to Grenadilla, and often takes on a richer and more complex tone than its rival, after a few months of playing. Mopane flutes come in many shades of brown, with different grain patterns. The wood has a rich tone quality, and is hypo-allergenic.</p><p class='p2'><b>African Olive</b> is another hypo-allergenic flute wood. It’s density varies more from tree to tree than does Mopane or Grenadilla, so its potential is less easy to categorize. A flute can be sweet, yet a real honker. It can play whisper tones, then blow you out of your seat. Whatever the case, an African Olive flute gives the most tactile feedback in the player’s hands. </p><p class='p2'>A flute made of any one of these three can dominate a session with a good embouchure and in the right hands.</p>
